 ## Dotfiles

This repo contains all my dotfiles. I use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage them.

To install them, clone this repo and run `stow .` in the root directory. This will create symlinks to all the dotfiles in your home directory.

To uninstall, run `stow -D .` in the root directory.
